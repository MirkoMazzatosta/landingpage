Hi guys! 

Here i am again with another repository!
It's about the final CSS exercise you can found in 
"The Odin Project" (Fundamentals).

I just created a Landing Page about a JDM showcase site
and i made it really simple, didn't add too many details.

I wanted it to be a working page: it is, so, mission complete!
